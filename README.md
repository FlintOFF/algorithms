## Sort

### Selection sort

O(n^2)
It compering the value with the rest values of the array and swap them if the order is wrong.

### Bubble sort

Also has O(n^2) but less effective then 'Selection sort'.
It compering only two adjacent values and swap them if order is wrong.

### Quick sort

O(log2n*2)
One of the most effective algorithm of sorting.
