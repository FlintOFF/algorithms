# Algorithms

## Search

## Sort

### Selection sort

O(n^2)
It compering the value with the rest values of the array and swap them if the order is wrong.

### Bubble sort

Also has O(n^2) but less effective then 'Selection sort'.
It compering only two adjacent values and swap them if order is wrong.

### Quick sort

O(log2n*2)
One of the most effective algorithm of sorting.

## Graph

### Breadth-first search

Can be used for answer the question "are points have a connections?".
For example we need to know that two computers in the local network can communicate between each other or not? 
The time complexity can be expressed as O(|V|+|E|), since every vertex and every edge will be explored in the worst case.
